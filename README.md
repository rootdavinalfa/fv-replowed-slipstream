## Installation (Docker)

Docker is the supported installation and deployment method. It runs the full
stack (Apache/PHP, MariaDB, and Reverb). On Ubuntu, run the complete setup in
this order:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make tools
make assets
make init
make items
make migrate
```

After the game data has been loaded, run the read-only quest contract audit:

```bash
docker compose exec -T fv-replowed-slipstream php artisan quest:audit-categories
```

It reports quest category requirements which no imported item can produce;
`--strict` makes those findings fail a CI or release check. It never creates
category aliases automatically.

`make tools` installs the MEGA downloader dependency. `make assets` downloads
and extracts the game files, then downloads `farmvilledb_trimmed.sql` from the
configured public MEGA folder into `.cache/fv-assets`. The four Internet
Archive WARC files are about 20 GB in total, and interrupted downloads resume
automatically. Once the game assets are present, repeated runs skip WARC
extraction.

### Asset extraction on ARM64 hosts

FVDehasher is distributed as an x86-64 Linux executable. On an ARM64 Ubuntu
host, `make assets` runs it through Docker, which needs the Docker daemon's
x86 emulation enabled once before the first extraction:

```bash
docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install amd64
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 alpine uname -m
```

The verification command must print `x86_64`. Then run `make assets`. Docker
must be installed and your user must be able to run `docker` without `sudo`.
The script runs the container under your host UID/GID so extracted assets stay
writable by your user. HTTP `416` lines while resuming WARC files mean the
local archive is already complete and are safe to ignore.

If an older extraction attempt left root-owned files and the final move fails
with `Permission denied`, repair ownership of only the affected project paths,
then run `make assets` again:

```bash
sudo chown -R "$USER:$USER" public/farmville .cache/fv-assets/farmville
```

The game is then served at `http://localhost:8000`; MariaDB is exposed on
port `33061`, and Reverb on port `8080`. Use `make stop` to stop the stack,
`make logs` to follow its logs, and `make test` to run the Laravel test suite.

For an internet-facing deployment, edit the untracked `.env` file before
starting the stack and set at least `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false`,
and unique database credentials.

### Discord sign-in and server membership

Sign-in and registration use Discord OAuth2. Set `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`,
`DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`, and an exactly matching `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI` from
the Discord Developer Portal. When `DISCORD_REQUIRED_GUILD_ID` is set, users
must be members of that Discord server to sign in. Set it to your private
Discord server ID in the deployment environment; do not commit that value.
The OAuth application must
request the `identify` and `guilds.members.read` scopes. Membership is checked
at sign-in and the session must be reverified after
`DISCORD_MEMBERSHIP_VERIFICATION_MINUTES` (7 days by default).

The Electron launcher uses the same `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI`. Its launcher OAuth
start route stores a short-lived state record, completes the Discord exchange
on the server, and relays a one-time handoff token to the launcher's loopback
callback. No additional Discord redirect URI is required. The handoff token is
valid for 60 seconds and is consumed once by `/auth/discord/launcher/consume`.

### Administrator access

Administrator access is assigned to individual registered accounts; there is no
shared admin password. After registering your owner account and running the
migrations, grant it access with:

```bash
docker compose exec fv-replowed-slipstream php artisan user:admin owner@example.com
```

To revoke access later, run the same command with `--revoke`. Only accounts
with this role can open `/admin` or call its currency-management endpoints.

## Apache2 Configuration

An example Apache2 configuration is included at `apache2-config`.
