# Flash client contract catalog

This document is the implementation map for the shipped FarmVille Flash
client. Its purpose is to replace symptom-driven fixes with a repeatable
process: identify the client contract, implement its server side, and record a
small reproducible test.

It is deliberately not a decompiler dump. Decompiled ActionScript is an
investigation aid and should remain uncommitted. This file records only the
behaviour that the PHP AMF service must honour.

## Rules for using this catalog

Each entry has one of these confidence levels:

- **Verified** — read directly from the matching shipped SWF and/or confirmed
  by an AMF request/response capture.
- **Implemented** — the server has code intended to meet the verified
  contract; it still needs the listed regression test.
- **Observed** — seen in a server log, but not yet traced through the SWF.
- **Unknown** — a client call exists, but its expected data/state has not yet
  been established. Do not invent a response based only on its name.

When a new problem is reported, first find its client service/action below.
If it is absent, add an **Observed** entry with the exact request from
`storage/logs/farmville.log`, then promote it to **Verified** only after
checking the relevant ActionScript class.

## Universal AMF transport contract

**Verified.** `Engine.Transactions.Transaction.onAmfComplete` passes the
service response's `data` object to a transaction callback. Callback-specific
fields therefore belong inside `data`; outer AMF transport fields such as
`errorType`, `sequenceNumber`, and `worldTime` are not callback payload.

Example:

```php
return [
    'data' => [
        'success' => true,
    ],
];
```

An AMF error response is not interchangeable with a successful no-op. Several
client flows leave a modal open when a repeated action returns an error. Where
the client can legally retry an already-completed action, prefer an idempotent
success with canonical state.

## Startup and asset contracts

### `UserService.initUser`

**Verified/implemented.** `Transactions.TInitUser` reads a substantial player
state payload directly from `data`, including `player`, `userInfo`, `world`,
`attr`, `experiments`, and `flashHotParams`.

The startup payload is high risk: do not add placeholder fields blindly.
Confirm the shape in `TInitUser.onComplete` before changing a field consumed
by Flash.

Regression test: register a clean account, open `/play`, reload once, and
confirm the farm loads without an ActionScript exception.

### `UserService.postInit`

**Verified/implemented.** `Transactions.TPostInit` reads optional feature
state, including `w2wState`, `avatarState`, `hudIcons`,
`fcSlotMachineRewards`, `bestSellers`, and `lotteryData`. Most are guarded by
the client, but present fields must retain the expected type.

Regression test: complete normal startup and inspect the first AMF batch for
unexpected `Method not found` errors that block a visible system.

### Free unwither flow

**Verified/implemented.** `TPostInit` creates
`Global.priceFormulaSettings` from `data.pricingTests`, not from the
`initUser` response. `UnwitherDialog` looks up the exact test name
`fv_unwither_optimization`; omitting that entry makes
`PriceFormulaSettings.getMultipleForTest` dereference a null setting and
crash with ActionScript Error #1009 when a withered crop is clicked.

The required shape is:

```php
'pricingTests' => [
    'fv_unwither_optimization' => [
        'type' => 'cash',
        'scheme' => ['multiple' => 0, 'cap' => 0],
    ],
],
```

The shipped SWF clamps the calculated cash price to a minimum of five, so a
zero formula alone cannot create a visibly free purchase. The offline build
therefore supplies the native `consume_unwither` gift-box consumable; the
same dialog detects that credit and uses its built-in free-consumable path.
`PurchaseUnwitherService.purchaseUnwitherItem` remains available for the
cash-purchase transaction contract.

Regression test: let at least one crop wither, click it, confirm the dialog
opens without Error #1009 and shows the consumable path, accept it, then
verify the crops become harvestable and no Farm Cash is deducted.

### Locale SWF

**Verified/implemented.** The client must receive the matching locale SWF for
the loaded FarmGame build. Quest text comes from this asset; a valid HTTP 200
with the wrong SWF is not sufficient. The Docker build maps the locale request
paths used by the preloader to the matching `en_US.swf` asset.

Regression test: start a normal quest and a `*bubble*` intro. Both the intro
bubbles and the objective panel must display text.

### Asset-path false positive: Lighthouse Cove background

**Incident note.** A Lighthouse Cove investigation initially concluded that
`xcove_themeBackground_12.swf` was missing because this request returned 404:

```text
/farmville/assets/hashed/assets/Environment/7ed449f2a87c572e9ff8b144b15e0b09.swf
```

That conclusion was wrong. The file was present both in the extracted asset
collection and in production under the optimized-SWF path:

```text
/farmville/assets/hashed/assets/opt/Environment/7ed449f2a87c572e9ff8b144b15e0b09.swf
```

The file is 50,525 bytes and its MD5 is
`7ed449f2a87c572e9ff8b144b15e0b09`, matching the asset-hash filename. The
archived WARC CDX entry also records the captured asset under
`assets/opt/Environment`, so this was a path-selection error, not an asset
recovery failure.

The shipped client can rewrite `assets/` to `assets/opt/` for the optimized SWF
experiment, and it has a separate `opt_qa` candidate. Therefore a 404 for the
ordinary path does not prove that an asset is absent.

Asset investigation checklist:

1. Record the logical path requested by the client, including filename case.
2. Resolve it through the matching `assethash.master.amf.gz` rather than
   guessing a hash or checking only the unhashed path.
3. Check the normal, `opt`, and `opt_qa` hashed paths, preserving the exact
   case of directories such as `Environment`.
4. Verify that any discovered file's MD5 matches the hash filename.
5. Only call the asset missing after checking the actual runtime request and
   the archive CDX/WARC source. A wrong candidate path, optimized asset path,
   or persisted client state can produce the same symptom.

This incident is distinct from the legacy FeatureBuilding shadow incident
documented below: that failure was caused by incompatible persisted object
state, while this one was caused by checking the wrong asset path.

### Coin farm expansions and incremental gates

**Verified/implemented.** Coin farm-expansion entries in the archived item
catalog used Facebook-neighbour requirements and legacy incremental gate
identifiers. The offline server has no corresponding Facebook graph or gate
service, but `FarmItem.checkIncrementalGate()` still runs while Flash builds
each Market slot.

The Docker build runs `scripts/patch-farm-expansion-settings.php`, which
preserves the original farm sizes and coin prices while removing the obsolete
neighbour and experiment gate fields from coin `expand_farm` entries and
making them level-1 eligible. The game page uses the versioned
`v855038-expansions-v1` catalog alias because some Flash players cache XML by
path and ignore a query-string revision.

There is also a startup-payload compatibility fallback. `player.incrementalGateArray`
must be an object whose entries are gate records, not the scalar `0`:

```php
'incrementalGateArray' => [
    'I001' => ['acquired' => true],
],
```

This is intentionally present even after XML patching: a browser can retain an
older item catalog. It makes the legacy `I001` gate safely available offline
instead of crashing the Market.

Diagnostic ladder for this class of failure:

1. A blank Farm Expansions category points to a catalog unlock/filter rule.
2. `Error #1069: Property I001 not found on Number` means the client read a
   gate entry but the containing `incrementalGateArray` had the wrong type.
3. `Error #1069: Property acquired not found on Number` means the container
   type is fixed but the specific gate value must itself be a record with an
   `acquired` member.
4. Rebuild the image and completely restart the Flash player before retesting:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Regression test: open Market > Farm Expansions, select Coin Expansions, verify
the slots render without an ActionScript error, and purchase the next eligible
coin expansion. Reload and verify the world size persists.

Related detailed notes: [QUEST_DEBUGGING.md](QUEST_DEBUGGING.md).

### `flashHotParams.MINIDARTS`

**Verified/implemented.** `MiniDartsManager` JSON-decodes
`Global.flashHotParams["MINIDARTS"]` in a field initializer. Feature-message
prerequisite evaluation can construct that manager during `TPostInit` even if
Mini Darts is not otherwise available. Therefore the key must always contain
valid JSON. The server supplies an expired runtime configuration, which keeps
the unfinished feature inactive without causing the startup `Error #1009`.

Regression test: launch an account that evaluates feature-message
prerequisites and confirm `TPostInit` completes with no stack involving
`MiniDartsManager` or `JSON.decode`.

## World actions and persistent world state

### `WorldService.performAction`

**Verified/implemented for the actions below.** The action name is the first
parameter, the world object is the second, and action options are typically
the first object in the third parameter array. The server must persist the
authoritative world change before returning a quest snapshot that depends on
it.

| Action | Persistent contract | Status / regression test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `place` | A market placement creates a world object; a placement from the gift box, home inventory, or a positive building-storage ID consumes exactly one existing item and must not create a market purchase. If placement fails, restore the withdrawn item. | Implemented. Place an animal from each source, reload, and verify exactly one copy exists. |
| `harvest` | Update the target object's post-harvest state and award/track only after persistence succeeds. Resolve the authoritative item by position, with the stable object ID as a fallback for FeatureBuilding/habitat snapshots. | Implemented for normal world actions. Harvest a crop/animal, reload, and verify state and quest count. |
| `plow`, `clear`, `clearWithered`, `move`, `sell` | Apply the corresponding position/object state change without losing persistent object fields such as `contents`. | Implemented baseline; regression test each action on a stored building and an ordinary plot. |
| `instantGrow` | Advance eligible object state and apply cash cost only when the world update succeeds. | Implemented baseline; regression test on a crop and a feature building. |
| `store` | Remove the loose resource and increment the target building's `contents` using Flash entries shaped as `{ itemCode, numItem }`. Do **not** substitute generic home inventory for a building's own contents. A store immediately following a placement may still name Flash's temporary object ID (63000–65500), so resolve that player's short-lived placement-to-persisted-ID mapping and verify the resource's item before moving it. | Implemented. See animal pen contract below. |
| `setMultipleFeaturedItems` | Save a feature building's featured slot map and return it under `data.featuredItems`. | Implemented. Store an animal, reload, and verify the displayed animal remains. |

### Derived withered plot state

**Verified/implemented.** Flash keeps a planted crop's saved row as
`state = planted` and derives its visible `grown` or `withered` state from the
plant timestamp, grid position, crop `growTime`, and the MD5-seeded wither
window. The server uses the same calculation before validating harvest,
unwither, single plow, and equipment plow actions. Crops with `expires=false`
can mature but never enter the withered state, and active Unwither Ring
protection prevents withering.

A visually withered plot sent through the client's `plow` path is converted to
`plowed`, its crop fields are cleared, and the normal plow transaction is
applied exactly once. Genuinely planted or grown plots remain protected from
stale plow replays. The derived state is not periodically written to every
plot; it is evaluated at the action boundary so the persisted representation
continues to match Flash's world contract.

### World-object serialization

**Verified/implemented.** A world object is not only its visible fields.
Storage/feature objects may require `contents`, `components`, expansion data,
and class-specific top-level state on reload. Preserve fields not owned by a
particular action instead of replacing the object with the small object sent
by Flash.

`app/Models/WorldObject.php` is the canonical boundary between database state
and Flash world objects. New special fields should be stored in `components`
when appropriate, then emitted at the top-level expected by the client.

### Crafting Silo

**Verified/implemented.** `craftingsilo` is a completed `FeatureBuilding`.
The market placement can serialize it with the generic `bare` state, but the
Craftshop checks for a completed silo and otherwise displays “place a crafting
silo” even when its world row exists. Persist it as `grown` with an
`expansionLevel` of at least one; level one provides the initial ten ingredient
slots. `crafting:repair-silos` repairs older `bare` records.

The purchase flow also reads the top-level `craftingSiloMaxCapacity` field
from the `TInitUser`/`TFarmTransaction` response. Emit it from the active
world's Silo expansion level (10 at level one, then the item definition's
upgrade capacities); otherwise Flash defaults capacity to zero and shows the
same prompt even when the object was successfully loaded.

Regression test: place or load a Crafting Silo, reload, open the Craftshop,
and begin a recipe without receiving the missing-silo prompt.

### Harvest bushel action drop

**Verified/implemented.** The shipped `gameSettings.xml` registers an
`actionDrop` named `bushelReport` with drop type
`updateHarvestCountAndConditionallyAwardBushel`. It applies to harvested seed
crops while `fv_simplified_bushels` is variant 2. The Flash client reads the
result from `metadata.ActionDrops.bushelReport.dropTypeFuncResult`, not from
the ordinary action `data` payload.

The server stores a per-crop harvest counter, grants its matching
`bushelItemCode` after every 50 accepted crop harvests, and returns both any
`foundBushel` records and `newHarvestQuantities`. `CraftingManager` immediately
places the awarded bushel into the correct live crafting bucket; the stored
counter restores through `player.seedHarvestCountsSinceLastBushelDrop` after a
reload. `FlashService` must merge this metadata with `QuestComponent` rather
than replacing it.

Regression test: harvest 50 of a seed crop with a `bushelItemCode`, confirm
one matching bushel appears without a reload in the Market Stall/Craftshop
inventory, then reload and confirm both the bushel and remaining crop counter
persist. Repeat once using a harvester or combine.

### In-game console player attributes

**Verified/implemented.** `ConsoleStandardCommandsModule.setCash`, `setGold`,
and `setXp` first update Flash's local player object, then call
`InGameConsoleService.adminCall` with the JSON payload
`{ adminController: "CPanelUserStatsController", adminCommand:
"setPlayerAttributes", cash|gold|xp: "<integer>" }`. The server persists
the supplied supported attributes within their normal caps and returns the
canonical balances. Without this handler, a console cash value disappears on
reload and server-authoritative purchases—including instant crafting—reject
the client-only balance.

Regression test: use `std.setCash 1000`, reload, and confirm the balance is
still 1,000; immediately buy an instant recipe costing less than 1,000 cash.

### Crafting recipe completion

**Verified/implemented.** `TClaimFinishedRecipes` forwards `data` directly
to `CraftingRecipeQueueManager.endFinishedRecipesClaimed()`, which iterates an
array of records. Each completed record needs `recipeId`, `productItemCode`,
`numGiftProducts`, and `recipeLevel`; the client removes the finished queue
entry and adds the crafted item to its live inventory from those values. An
empty success object deletes the server queue row but leaves the client flow
without its completion result.

Completed goods persist in `FarmGameWorld.CRAFTEDGOODS_ID` (`-7`), not the
crafting-silo or market-stall inventory. Their storage key is
`itemCode:recipeLevel`, and `initUser.player.storageData[-7]` must restore
that same shape after reload. `TCraftInstantRecipe` has a separate contract:
it reads `productItemCode` and `numGiftProducts` then calls `player.addGift`,
so instant-recipe rewards must be saved to the giftbox.

Regression test: complete one timed recipe and one instant recipe. In both
cases, the completion UI must close, the reward must appear immediately, and
it must still be present after a reload.

### Animal pens and Pet Runs

**Verified/implemented.** A Pet Run identifies itself as `FeatureBuilding`
but inherits Flash storage behaviour:

1. Flash harvests the loose animal.
2. Flash calls `performAction("store")` with the pen ID, animal item code, and
   resource ID.
3. Flash first calls `performAction("setFeaturedItem")` with `itemSlot`,
   `itemCode`, `metaHash`, and `removeOrAdd`; it later calls
   `setMultipleFeaturedItems` for slot compaction/removal. Both forms must
   persist the slot map, e.g. `{ "4": { "itemCode": "7iV", "metaHash": "7iV:" } }`.
4. On reload, `FeatureBuilding.loadObject()` expects `contents`,
   `storageMetadata`, and `featuredItems` at the object top level.

The implementation persists `contents` plus featured items in the building's
components and re-emits them at the required top level. Positive storage IDs
withdraw from that exact building before an animal is placed back on the farm.
Generic actions such as harvesting the building can send `components: {}`;
they do not own storage state and must merge the persisted `featuredItems`,
`storageMetadata`, and `paintColor` rather than erase them.
When Flash sends a later full-world update, it may return those storage fields
only at the top level; the server must merge them back into components rather
than replacing a featured-animal map with an empty component object.
`setMultipleFeaturedItems` is a one-building transaction and must update only
that persisted building. It must never re-save the caller's whole cached farm:
doing so can overwrite a different pen that was changed by its own atomic
store transaction.
Flash temporary object IDs (63000–65500) must never be persisted by any
whole-world snapshot. They are client-only placeholders until the matching
`place` response supplies a safe server ID; persisting one creates a second,
loose copy when the player reloads.
For legacy rows that retained contents but missed the single-slot action, the
reload serializer derives a deterministic featured-slot map from contents so
the animals remain visible while the stored data is preserved.

Regression test: harvest an animal, put it in a Pet Run, reload, remove it
from the Pet Run, reload, then repeat. Also place an animal and immediately
put it back in the same pen before the client applies the placement response.
At every stage verify there is one and only one animal.

### Chicken Coops

**Verified/implemented.** `ChickenCoopBuilding` extends Flash's
`HarvestableStorageBuilding`. A Coop containing chickens is harvestable only
when its state is `ripe`, or when its `bare` timer has elapsed; a
`built` state is a capacity-only state and cannot be clicked to harvest. On a
successful harvest, Flash sends the ordinary
`WorldService.performAction("harvest", worldObject, ...)` request and expects
the server to reset the building to `bare` with a fresh `plantTime`.

Older server records could retain `contents` while remaining `built`, leaving
an apparently permanent but uncollectible Coop. The repair migration marks
those populated records `ripe` so they can be collected immediately; the
normal harvest path then starts the next timer. Quest category resolution maps
Chicken Coop variants to `Coop`, so `harvestByCategory allCoop` objectives
persist on that same harvest.

Regression test: load an existing populated Coop, collect it once, reload and
confirm it is `bare` with a timer; instant-grow or wait for readiness, collect
again, reload, and verify an `allCoop` task remains at 2/2.

### Star Tree quest variants

**Verified/implemented.** FarmQuest's `harvestByCategory allstartrees`
objective applies to the Star Tree family, not only the base `startree` item.
The server therefore recognizes normalized item keys containing `startree`,
including `shootingstartree`, when recording quest progress. This keeps the
counter authoritative across a reload.

Regression test: harvest a `shootingstartree`, reload, and confirm an active
`allstartrees` task retains the increment.

### Legacy Tree render state

**Verified/implemented.** Flash's `Tree` class recognizes `bare` and `ripe`
states. Earlier generic saves could serialize a mature Tree as `grown`; that
is not a Tree state, so Flash leaves only the placement shadow visible after a
reload. `WorldObject` normalizes only `className = Tree` plus `state = grown`
to `ripe` when reading and writing. A one-time migration repairs existing
records. Do not apply this mapping to other object classes: their `grown`
state may be valid.

### Pink Rose quest category

**Verified/implemented.** The pink rose crop is stored as `rosepink`, while
FarmQuest names its shared harvest category `allPinkRoses`. The server maps
that crop key to `PinkRoses`, so its harvest counter is saved across reloads.

### Quest category coverage audit

`php artisan quest:audit-categories --strict` compares every category-based
quest objective with the imported item catalog, habitat families, and crafting
recipes. Run it after importing new game data and before deployment. The
command reports unresolved contracts without guessing at aliases; once the
catalog identifies an unambiguous internal key, add and regression-test that
mapping in `QuestCategoryResolver`. This caught the legacy keys
`greenstrawberries`, `squashpetitpan`, `cornergasstation`, and the Swim Hole
habitat before their objectives were tested by players.

### Server-authoritative recipe and mastery quests

Quest settings mark every action with a durable server implementation as
`requireServerReponse="true"`. This includes recipe and mastery objectives as
well as world actions: `makeRecipeByCode`, `makeRecipeByCategory`,
`makeRecipeAny`, `getMasteryLevelByCode`, and `getMasteryLevelByCategory`.
Without that setting Flash can paint local task progress, but discard it when
the next initialization reconciles with the server.

### Permanent mastery statues

**Verified/implemented from `Mastery.calculateMasteryYield` and
`PermanentBuffDecoration`.** A placed permanent-mastery decoration exposes a
backing buff through its item `buff` field. Each distinct backing buff whose
`masteryTypes` includes the harvested item's type adds one extra mastery
multiplier. Thus the Bronze Animal Mastery Statue (`dmstatuebronze`) activates
`buff_permanent_mastery_animal` and changes an animal's normal yield of one to
two. The server derives active permanent buffs from the player's undeleted
world objects, so existing placed statues work after deployment and duplicate
copies of the same buff do not stack. The final mastery yield is capped at five
to match Flash.

### Legacy completed animal-breeding buildings

**Verified/implemented.** This is a reload/render-state compatibility rule for
completed `FeatureBuilding` records whose item name matches
`animal_breeding_*_finished`, including the legacy equivalents
`xuk_sheep_pen_finished`, `babybunnyhutch_finished`, and
`flower_garden_finished`. The Halloween Orchard
`xhworchard_featurebuilding_finished` uses the same incompatible saved
`grown` state, although its client class is `OrchardFeatureBuilding`. It is
deliberately separate from the animal-pen storage contract above.

Older saved records can have `state = "grown"`, with or without populated
`components.featuredItems`. The current Flash client does not define `grown`
as a `FeatureBuilding` state and therefore does not restore a normal building
visual: it shows only the dark placement footprint/shadow. This can look
exactly like a missing SWF or bitmap asset, but the asset is not the cause. A
newly placed Dino Lab showed the same building working with the normal `bare`
state.

`WorldObject` is the compatibility boundary. On both read and write it changes
only this narrow legacy combination from `grown` to `bare`:

- item name begins with `animal_breeding_` and ends with `_finished`, or is the
  legacy regional Sheep Pen `xuk_sheep_pen_finished` or Baby Bunny Hutch
  `babybunnyhutch_finished`, Bloom Garden `flower_garden_finished`, or
  Halloween Orchard `xhworchard_featurebuilding_finished`;
- class name is `FeatureBuilding` (the Halloween Orchard uses its own class and
  is repaired separately).

It preserves the object ID, location, contents, other components, and all
upgrade/storage fields, including a non-empty featured-item map. Do not apply
this rule to arbitrary `grown` objects. Existing malformed rows are safe to
repair with the same rule in a one-time data migration.

FeatureBuilding instant-grow uses `ripe`, not the crop state `grown`. The
server must keep that distinction: writing `grown` makes Flash show a local
ready animation but the compatibility layer restores `bare` on save, causing a
later harvest attempt not to reach a server-persisted quest counter.

Quest settings also register `instantGrow` as a transaction for
`harvestByCategory`. When instant-growing eligible objects, the server records
the corresponding category progress after its world write succeeds; otherwise
Flash can show a completion popup that disappears on reload.

Regression test: place or load each affected building type (Dino Lab, Horse
Paddock, Pet Run, Livestock building), reload the farm, and confirm that the
building art remains visible and that opening it still preserves its contents.
Do not begin an asset re-extraction merely because a world object appears as a
shadow; inspect its persisted state and components first.

## Quest contracts

The detailed history and implementation notes are in
[QUEST_DEBUGGING.md](QUEST_DEBUGGING.md). This section is the concise contract
index.

| Service/method | Client contract | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FarmQuestService.questManagerStartReplayableQuestChain` | Starts a replayable intro. A completed repeat must return successful canonical quest state rather than an AMF error. | Implemented. |
| `FarmQuestService.questManagerEndReplayableQuestChain` | Removes the selected replayable chain from saved active quests and returns a successful refreshed quest component. | Implemented. |
| `FarmQuestService.markViewDialogTaskDone` | Acknowledges the intro after its dialogue. It must be idempotent because the server atomically starts the eligible child before Flash sends this acknowledgement. | Implemented. |
| `FarmQuestService.askForQuestItem` | `Transaction.onAmfComplete` passes the AMF response's outer `data` object to `TAskForQuestItem`, which requires that callback object to contain `data` and `ts`. The handler returns `data: { ts, data: { published: true } }` for a local immediate-publish acknowledgement. With no Facebook delivery path, it grants the remaining amount for the exact active `useItemByCode` task to the giftbox and advances that task's saved progress. It never grants an item for an inactive task or another task action. | Implemented. |
| `FBRequestService.sendAskItemsRequest` | The generic MFS “Ask Your Friends” screen sends only an item name and the `questR4R` feature name. In the offline deployment, resolve that item to an exact active `useItemByCode` task, grant only its remaining amount, and advance that task. This is separate from `FarmQuestService.askForQuestItem`, which a different Flash helper uses. | Implemented. |
| Quest component in action responses | Server-backed action counters must be returned as the authoritative quest component when the client is configured to wait for the server. | Implemented for supported actions. |
| `harvestByCode`, `harvestByCategory`, `plantCropByCode`, `plantCropByCategory`, `plowPlot`, `storeItemByCode`, `storeItemByAnySpecificInventoryStorage`, `useItemByCode` | Persist progress against the active quest and cap it at the task requirement. | Implemented. The Docker build marks these actions as server-backed in quest settings. `storeItemByAnySpecificInventoryStorage` is the name used by objectives such as “Store 10 Items on Your Home Farm”; it must not be treated as a client-only synonym. |
| Bulk equipment actions | `EquipmentWorldService` applies actions to multiple plots; task progress must use the affected count, not one event per request. | Implemented for bulk plow, plant, harvest, and combine. |

Important: crop categories such as `allWheat` are normalized from imported item
data; this avoids one hard-coded mapping per crop. Habitat objectives use
stable building families such as `petRunHabitat`, `livestockHabitat`, and
`paddockHabitat`.

Regression test: activate a three-task quest; make partial progress with both
ordinary and equipment actions; reload after each step; confirm the saved and
live counters agree.

## Gifts and inventory

### `PresentService.buyAndSend`

**Verified/implemented.** For a quest task using `useItemByCode`, giftbox
contents and quest progress are separate server state. A real service-mediated
gift must add the recipient's gift and update the recipient's server-side task
progress in the same flow.

Regression test: send an Ask Friends item to a player with the matching active
quest, reload their game, and confirm both gift availability and saved quest
progress.

Operator warning: editing `playermeta.giftbox` directly bypasses this service
contract. It can make a temporary client counter appear, but it does not by
itself update persisted quest state.

### Home inventory vs. building storage

**Verified/implemented.** These are different sources:

- Gift box: legacy `-1` and current `-6` identifiers.
- Home inventory: `-2`.
- A building's storage: its positive world-object ID.

Never treat all nonzero source IDs as the same inventory. That conflation is
what made stored animals duplicable.

## Feature systems awaiting contract work

These calls have been observed during normal startup or interaction. Their
absence is not automatically a visible bug, but any user-facing feature they
gate needs a contract before implementation.

| Service/method | Status | Next evidence needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CraftingService.onRefreshMarketView` | Observed; basic crafting-cottage persistence exists. | Trace the client callback and Winery open/queue flow, then capture one successful recipe lifecycle. |
| `FriendSetService.getBatchFriendSetData` | Observed; basic response exists. | Decompile callback for required friend-set shape before expanding social features. |
| `LonelyAnimalFriendSetService.getLonelyAnimalFriendSetData` | Observed. | Trace callback and record required state. |
| `UserService.getAskItemFriends` | Verified/implemented. `TGetAskItemFriends` passes its callback result to the MFS dialog, which reads `requestedFriends[friendType]` arrays. Local neighbors are returned as valid friends for every friend type requested by Flash. | Open an item-request dialog with at least one neighbor; both selection tabs must finish loading and show selectable neighbors. |
| `FBRequestService.sendAskItemsRequest` | Verified/implemented. `TSendAskItemsRequest` sends `(itemName, featureName, requestIds, source, expansion, view, serverTime)` after the client social bridge returns IDs. The offline service accepts the request, records a bounded audit entry, and returns a successful acknowledgement. | Select one or more friends and send an item request; the MFS dialog should advance/close and the server log should show `Offline Ask Items request accepted`. |
| `GiftingService.getGiftNameList` | Unknown. | Trace the requesting transaction and expected list format. |
| `PresentService.receiveAllPresents` | Unknown. | Trace client callback; do not return an arbitrary success object. |
| `UserService.incrementActionCount`, `setActionCount`, `resetSystemNotifications`, `updateFeatureFrequencyWithBackoff` | Observed no-op candidates. | Verify whether callback reads data or only needs a successful acknowledgement. |
| `WatchToEarnRewardGrantService.getUserZid` | Verified/implemented: return `data.success` and string `data.zid`. | Startup regression test. |
| `WatchToEarnRewardGrantService.generateDailyTokens` | Verified/implemented: return `data.success` and capitalized `data.Tokens` array. | Startup regression test. |
| World unlock services (`EnglandService`, `GlenService`, etc.) | Observed. | Treat as a world-access system; define authorization, world state, and callback payload once rather than implementing each named service ad hoc. |

## Implementation priority

The audit's raw call count is not the priority. Work in this order:

1. **Startup and persistent normal-play state** — `UserService` acknowledgements,
   item flags/options, feature-frequency state, and any call that can stop
   `TInitUser` or `TPostInit`. This avoids startup crashes and recurring
   `Method not found` noise.
2. **Gifts and Ask Friends** — `PresentService.receivePresent`,
   `PresentService.receiveAllPresents`, and the friend-selection calls. These
   need one durable pending-present model and an AMF callback trace; do not
   replace them with an empty success response.
3. **World object and crafting lifecycle** — the specific `WorldService` and
   `CraftingService` calls required for placing, opening, storing, claiming,
   and reloading. Each implementation must be reload-tested.
4. **Social progression** — Friend Set, neighbor interaction, and gifting
   variants. Implement a whole feature family at a time rather than isolated
   endpoint names.
5. **Optional/event systems** — ZAPI, ads, promotions, breeding events,
   cross-game campaigns, raffles, and old world campaigns. They are numerous
   in the audit but should not displace a normal-play contract.

### First-pass normal-play acknowledgements

**Verified/implemented.** The following transactions are ordinary client
state updates. Their callbacks are either absent or read only the listed
field, so they are safe to implement before larger event/social systems:

| Service/method | Persisted state | Callback contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UserService.incrementActionCount` | Per-flag action count | No callback; returns `data.actionCount` for observability. |
| `UserService.incrementIntervalActionCount` | Per-flag count and interval start time | `data.actionCount`. |
| `UserService.resetSystemNotifications` | Last reset timestamp | No callback; successful `data` acknowledgement. |
| `UserService.updateFeatureFrequencyWithBackoff` | Timestamp and capped increment | No callback; successful `data` acknowledgement. |
| `UserService.saveOptions` | Sound/music/animation settings | No callback; settings are restored in `initUser`. |
| `UserService.setItemFlag` | Item-flag map | No callback; flags are restored in `initUser`. |
| `CraftingService.onMarkCottageHistorySeen` | Per-craft-type acknowledgement | `data.responseCode`. |

Regression test: reload once after changing options or dismissing a cottage
history prompt; verify that the state persists and no `Method not found`
entry is logged for these calls.

## How to add a contract

1. Reproduce the feature using a clean or known test account.
2. Save the precise service, method, and parameters from
   `storage/logs/farmville.log`.
3. Locate the transaction/callback in the matching shipped SWF with JPEXS.
4. Record only fields the callback reads and only state the next load requires.
5. Mark the entry **Verified** and implement it at the correct persistence
   boundary.
6. Add a short reload-oriented regression test. A feature is not restored
   until it survives a reload.

Useful logs:

```bash
docker compose exec fv-replowed-slipstream sh -lc 'tail -f storage/logs/farmville.log'
docker compose logs -f fv-replowed-slipstream
```

For every contract change, keep the implementation isolated by feature family
and document it here before committing. This makes future integration much
less dependent on rediscovering client behaviour from scratch.

## PowerShell Flash reverse-engineering playbook

Use this when a Flash symptom needs an actual client-contract trace. It is
intended to be copied into a PowerShell session from the repository root.
Decompiled ActionScript belongs in a temporary directory and must not be
committed.

### Prerequisites and common variables

Install [JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler)
and point `$ffdec` at its command-line executable. The exact extracted folder
varies by JPEXS package; use the actual `ffdec-cli.exe` path on the machine.

```powershell
$ffdec = 'C:\path\to\ffdec-cli.exe'
$swf = 'public/farmville/embeds/Flash/v855037.855026/FarmGame.855037.855026.swf'

if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $ffdec)) { throw "JPEXS CLI not found: $ffdec" }
if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath $swf)) { throw "FarmGame SWF not found: $swf" }
```

If JPEXS was unpacked under the temporary folder, this is a common shape (only
use it if that file exists):

```powershell
$ffdec = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'fv-ffdec-26.2.1\tool\ffdec-cli.exe'
```

### 1. Find the relevant ActionScript class

Do not export the entire SWF first. Its script dump is very large. Query the
class index and select the small group relevant to the reported symptom:

```powershell
$idx = & $ffdec -dumpAS3 $swf
$idx | Where-Object { $_ -match 'QuestManager$|QuestSettingsInit|QuestEvent' } |
    Select-Object -First 40 | Out-String

$idx | Where-Object { $_ -match 'ZQuest' -and $_ -match 'Manager|SettingsInit' } |
    Out-String
```

For example, a world-action quest counter normally involves `TWorldState`,
`TFarmTransaction`, `QuestManager`, `FarmQuestManager`, and
`FarmQuestSettingsInit`.

### 2. Export only the selected classes

`parallelSpeedUp=false` avoids high memory usage when running JPEXS against
the large FarmGame SWF. Each investigation gets a separate temporary folder,
which is safe to overwrite.

```powershell
$out = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'fv-transaction-metadata'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $out -Force | Out-Null

& $ffdec -config parallelSpeedUp=false `
  -selectclass 'Transactions.TFarmTransaction,Engine.Transactions.Transaction,Engine.Managers.TransactionManager,Classes.Quest.FarmQuestManager' `
  -export script $out $swf

rg -n -C 12 'metadata|QuestComponent|questComponent|onAmfComplete' `
  "$out\scripts" -g '*.as'
```

For the complete server-progress path, export the generic and FarmVille quest
managers plus their settings parsers:

```powershell
$out = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'fv-quest-server-progress'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $out -Force | Out-Null

& $ffdec -config parallelSpeedUp=false `
  -selectclass 'ZQuest.Managers.QuestManager,Classes.Quest.FarmQuestManager,Classes.Quest.FarmQuestSettingsInit,ZQuest.Init.QuestSettingsInit' `
  -export script $out $swf

rg -n -C 12 'metadata|QuestComponent|shouldUpdateProgressFromServerResponse|onTransactionComplete|progress|requireServer' `
  "$out\scripts" -g '*.as'
```

For a focused check of a world callback and the QuestComponent classes:

```powershell
$out = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'fv-world-quest-callback'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $out -Force | Out-Null

& $ffdec -config parallelSpeedUp=false `
  -selectclass 'Transactions.TWorldState,ZQuest.Classes.QuestComponent,Classes.Quest.FarmQuestComponent' `
  -export script $out $swf

Get-ChildItem "$out\scripts" -Recurse -Filter '*.as' | ForEach-Object {
    "`n===== $($_.Name) ====="
    Get-Content $_.FullName -Raw
}
```

Some class names differ by client revision. If JPEXS says a selected class is
missing, use the index command above and export the equivalent class it lists.

### 3. Read the server and client sides together

After finding the client callback, read the corresponding PHP builder and the
specific ActionScript methods side by side. For the quest component:

```powershell
Get-Content public/farmville/flashservices/amfphp/Helpers/quest_helper.php |
    Select-Object -Skip 445 -First 55

Get-Content "$env:TEMP\fv-transaction-metadata\scripts\Classes\Quest\FarmQuestManager.as" |
    Select-Object -Skip 335 -First 195

Get-Content "$env:TEMP\fv-transaction-metadata\scripts\Transactions\TFarmTransaction.as" |
    Select-Object -Skip 60 -First 130
```

Line offsets are a convenience, not a contract. If a different SWF revision
changes them, search by method name instead:

```powershell
rg -n -C 10 'shouldUpdateProgressFromServerResponse|shouldDispatchQuestProgress|taskTypesRequiring|requireServer' `
  "$env:TEMP\fv-transaction-metadata\scripts\Classes\Quest\FarmQuestManager.as" `
  "$env:TEMP\fv-quest-server-progress\scripts\Classes\Quest\FarmQuestSettingsInit.as"
```

### 4. Verify the source and Docker delivery path

Many client settings files are patched only during the image build. Inspect
both the patch and the page flashvars before assuming a source file is the
runtime file:

```powershell
Get-Content scripts/patch-quest-settings.php -Raw
Get-Content Dockerfile -Raw
Get-Content docker-compose.yaml -Raw

rg -n -C 5 'questSettings|xml/gz|locale' Dockerfile apache2-config public `
  -g '!*.swf' -g '!*.gz'
```

For quest-progress work, the tracked source archive is deliberately unchanged:
`scripts/patch-quest-settings.php` modifies the copy inside the Docker image.
After changing that script or the quest URL revision, rebuild the stack and
hard-refresh `/play` so Flash receives the new settings URL:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 5. Capture the runtime evidence

Keep a log tail open while performing one exact action, then record the
request parameters, response contract, and reload result in this catalog:

```bash
docker compose exec fv-replowed-slipstream sh -lc 'tail -f storage/logs/farmville.log'
docker compose logs -f fv-replowed-slipstream
```

For a quest-counter report, the important evidence is the one world-action
request and the following `QuestProgress` entry. A `Saved ... updates=[...]`
line proves persistence; it does not by itself prove that Flash received the
correct response shape or uncached quest settings.

## Proactive coverage audit

`scripts/audit-flash-contracts.ps1` exports the matching SWF's ActionScript,
collects literal client service/method calls, and compares them with the PHP
handlers under `public/farmville/flashservices/amfphp/Functions`. It also:

- extracts direct fields read from transaction callback objects;
- distinguishes a missing handler from a handler file that exists but is not
  loaded by `Services/FlashService.php`;
- batches JPEXS exports so the full transaction set stays below Windows'
  command-line length limit.

Run it from PowerShell on a machine with JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler:

```powershell
.\scripts\audit-flash-contracts.ps1 `
  -FfdecPath 'C:\path\to\ffdec-cli.exe'
```

It writes an untracked report to `storage/app/flash-contract-audit.md`. The
first pass scans the SWF transaction layer (rather than exporting every client
class, which is unnecessarily memory-intensive). Use the report as a backlog:
group missing calls by feature family, trace the callback for the ones relevant
to normal play, then promote the result into this catalog. A missing handler is
a lead, not sufficient evidence to invent its response shape. Callback fields
are conservative first-level reads; fields reached through aliases, nested
objects, or helper methods still require a focused decompile.

## Executable response fixtures

`tests/Fixtures/flash_response_contracts.php` records high-risk AMF callbacks
as executable response contracts. `tests/Unit/FlashResponseContractTest.php`
checks that each method exists, its service file is registered by
`FlashService`, and its response contains the required keys, types, and fixed
values.

Add a fixture whenever a verified client callback is implemented or repaired.
Keep fixtures focused on fields proven to be read by Flash; do not freeze large
placeholder responses merely because the audit lists them. Stateful handlers
may use `registered_only` until a database-backed lifecycle test exists.

Run the fast fixtures with the normal test suite:

```bash
php artisan test --filter FlashResponseContractTest
```

Together, the generated audit and executable fixtures form the proactive loop:
the audit discovers likely gaps from the SWF, focused tracing establishes the
real contract, and a fixture prevents that contract from regressing.

## Completed quest journal state

The green task checkmarks only mean `checkAndCompleteQuest()` has marked an
active quest ready to finish. `QuestComponent.complete` must nevertheless
remain `false` while the quest is active: the SWF uses `complete: true` to skip
server-progress reconciliation, which prevents its own `QuestEvent.COMPLETED`
from firing. Flash then sends
`FarmQuestService.updateRecentlyCompletedQuests` after the reward/share flow.
That acknowledgement remains an idempotent compatibility path. The durable
transition now happens earlier: when a server-tracked action brings the final
saved task counter to its requirement, `trackQuestProgress()` finalizes the
quest, grants rewards, removes it from active state, and stores its name in
`quest_completed`. This is necessary because some client flows paint every
green checkmark but never send the later acknowledgement before a refresh.

On the next initialization, `UserService.postInit` returns that list as
`completedQuests`; `TPostInit` passes it to `FarmQuestManager`, which populates
the journal's Completed tab. Returning `null` here leaves the tab empty even
when the saved quest state is correct.

Replayable quests use a separate `completedReplayableQuests` object keyed by
the quest definition's `memStoreId`. The SWF turns each entry into a
`ReplayableFarmQuestData` record, requiring `completion_count` and
`completion_date`. The local server stores only completed quest names, so it
reconstructs that response object from the normalized `quests` table.

For saves produced before the `QuestComponent.complete` correction,
`finalizePendingCompletedQuests()` repairs only quests already persisted as
completed-but-active during `postInit`. This moves the stuck quest into history
and evaluates its child quests without touching in-progress work.

### First contract completed with the loop

`LeaderboardService.getBatchFriendLists` is called during ordinary startup.
`TGetLeaderboardFriendLists` sends an array of leaderboard names, then looks up
each callback value directly as `result[leaderboardName]`. The offline handler
therefore returns every requested name as a key with an empty array value. This
finishes the original callbacks without fabricating Facebook friend data. Its
two-name response shape is covered by the executable fixture suite.
